The issue arises when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within a custom directive.  For instance, if you define a custom directive like this:

```html
<script>
  const myDirective = {
    mounted: function (el) {
      el.classList.add('bg-blue-500', 'p-4')
    }
  }
</script>

<div v-bind:class="{'bg-blue-500 p-4': true}"></div>
<div v-bind:class="['bg-blue-500', 'p-4']"></div>
<div v-myDirective></div>
```

And then attempt to use `@apply` within a Tailwind class, it may not work as expected.  The `@apply` directive is designed to work during the build process, not at runtime, so it won't dynamically apply styles when added through Javascript.
