The solution is to avoid relying on `@apply` for dynamically added classes. Instead, apply the necessary utility classes directly using JavaScript.  For example, instead of:

```html
<div v-myDirective></div>
```

And:

```javascript
const myDirective = {
  mounted: function (el) {
    el.classList.add('bg-blue-500', 'p-4') //Directly add classes
  }
}
```

This approach ensures that the styles are applied correctly regardless of when the classes are added to the element.
